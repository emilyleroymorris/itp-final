	<h2>Characters</h2>

	<img src="images/character.jpg" alt="The whole group plays True American" class="floatleft">

	<h3>Jess</h3>

		<p>She is a bubbly young woman trying to find herself again after a shocking breakup with her boyfriend. She has been a teacher since 2006 and she loves to play the handbells. Jess enjoys crafting but doesn't have much time for it anymore.</p>

		<p> Nicknames include: Jebecca, Rebecca Johnson, Two-Boobs Johnson, Tiger Boobs, Jess Jess, Ivy, Loft Troll, Dirty J, Dr Day My Toilet Sister, Giggle Bangs Rice Bowl, Katie, Yolanda Winston, Toilet Pants, Joey, Trebecca, PJ </p>

	<h3>Schmidt</h3>

		<p>Schmidt is a narcissistic, self-proclaimed "alpha male", who sees himself as being greater than he really is. His roommates all agree he's a douche and every time he does something douchey, he's forced to put a dollar in the douche jar. Over the series, this jar overflows with money. Schmidt is very annoying, as he not only has an unhealthy concern for his appearance but is also constantly bragging about his few and laughable excuses for accomplishments in life to his roommates, much to their annoyance. 

		<p>As self-absorbed as Schmidt is, he is also a genuinely caring guy for others, helping out his friends such as Jess and CeCe, when they're in times of distress and is all around a good friend.</p>

	<h3>Winston</h3>

		<p> Oblivious and goofy, Winston is the sweet yet often dopey one in the apartment. Despite his occasional intellectual shortcomings, his roommates often turn to him for words of advice. His childlike qualities, such as the fact that he still believes in Santa Claus, make him an ideal companion for the cynical Nick and the aggressive Schmidt. </p>

	<h3>Nick</h3>

		<p>Nick is an apathetic, socially inept, extremely sarcastic, and hilarious bartender from Chicago who has a keen ability for reading people's emotions although he can't seem to express his own. </p>


	<h3>Cece</h3>
		<p> Reasonable, charming, and tough. The grounded and realistic Cece is always there to offer advice to Jess, the airy and childlike dreamer. Sometimes this advice might take the form of tough love, but there is no one else in Jess’s life who isn’t afraid to say, “Please don’t make me laugh at you."</p>

	<h2>Best Quotes</h2>

	<img src="images/quote.jpg" alt="Schmidt appaled by white men." class="floatright">

	<p>"I brake for birds. I rock a lot of polka dots. I have touched glitter in the last 24 hours! And that doesn't mean I'm not smart and tough and strong." --Jess </p>

	<p>"You gave me cookie I got you cookie, man." --Nick </p>

	<p>"If I were off my rocker, would I take a weekly selfie with my cat?" --Winston </p>

	<p>“Nick isn’t even a man. He’s some kind of man-boy, man-child hybrid. The other day I had to tell him not to pull a dog’s tail.” --Schmidt</p>
